# The PawParrazi Project
## A Social Media Application for Canines

This Social Media Application is for Man's Best Friend: Our Dogs. 
It was created to post dog accounts and connect with other dog pals.

On the first page, there is a login form where the user can login or create a new account using a username, email, and password.
Once logged-in, the users recent posts are displayed. There are options to create a new post, edit previous posts, and delete posts.
When the user navigates to the home page, they will see the most recent posts by all of the dogs' social accounts. 
Comments can be added under each post.
There is a log-out option in the navigation menu for when users are finished using the app.


### Features:

~ This application uses a Node and Express back-end and uses GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new canine data.
